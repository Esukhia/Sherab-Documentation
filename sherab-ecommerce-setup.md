# Complete Guide to Setting Up E-commerce for Sherab with WordPress/WooCommerce

## What Is This Integration?

-   WordPress website as your course catalog and storefront
-   WooCommerce handling payments, orders, and customer management
-   Automatic enrollment in Sherab when courses are purchased
-   Professional e-commerce features like coupons, analytics, and
    marketing tools

## How It Works

1.  **Installation Process**

    ``` bash
    pip install -U tutor-contrib-wordpress
    tutor plugins enable wordpress
    tutor dev launch
    ```

    This automatically installs:

    -   Complete WordPress installation
    -   WooCommerce e-commerce plugin
    -   Sherab Commerce plugin (the bridge between systems)

    You do NOT need to:

    -   Install WooCommerce separately
    -   Download the OpenEdX Commerce plugin manually
    -   Set up the traditional OpenEdX e-commerce service
    -   Run database migrations

2.  **Manual Configuration Required**

    -   Create OAuth2 application in Sherab Django admin
    -   Configure WordPress plugin settings with OAuth2 credentials
    -   Test the connection between systems

3.  **You can retrieve these configuration values by running:**

    ``` bash
       tutor wordpress config printroot    
    ```
    
## Detailed Setup Steps

### Phase 1: OAuth2 Setup in Sherab

-   Access Django admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin`
-   Go to **OAuth2 Provider → Applications → Add Application**
-   Configure:
    -   Client type: Confidential
    -   Authorization grant type: Client credentials
    -   User: Select staff user
    -   Name: "WordPress Commerce"
-   Copy Client ID and Secret

### Phase 2: WordPress Configuration

-   Access WordPress at `http://localhost:8080`
-   In admin → WooCommerce → Settings → Integration → OpenEdX
-   Enter:
    -   LMS Domain
    -   Client ID
    -   Client Secret
-   Test connection with "Generate JWT Token"

### Phase 3: Creating Course Products

-   In WordPress admin → Products → Add New
-   Add name, price, description, images
-   Check **OpenEdX Course**
-   Configure:
    -   Course ID (e.g., `course-v1:MySchool+Math101+2024`)
    -   Course Mode (audit, honor, verified, etc.)
-   Publish

## Understanding Course Modes

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mode                 Description                   Certificate   Payment
                                                                   Required
  -------------------- ----------------------------- ------------- ---------------
  audit                Free access, no certificate   No            No

  honor                Free access with certificate  Yes           No

  verified             Paid with verified            Yes           Yes
                       certificate                                 

  no-id-professional   Professional, no ID           Yes           Yes
                       verification                                
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purchase-to-Enrollment Workflow

1.  Purchase in WordPress
2.  Order processed by WooCommerce
3.  Plugin detects order
4.  Enrollment request created with billing email
5.  API call to OpenEdX
6.  Enrollment created in specified course/mode

## Refund Handling

-   Refund in WooCommerce → Plugin soft unenrolls user
-   User loses course access but retains progress

## Course Discovery and Pricing

-   Prices and buy buttons only on WordPress storefront
-   OpenEdX pages: add manual "Buy this course" links to WordPress

## Student Experience

-   Browse courses in WordPress
-   Purchase via WooCommerce
-   Automatic enrollment in OpenEdX
-   Learn in OpenEdX

## System Architecture

-   WordPress: storefront, payments, accounts, marketing
-   OpenEdX: course content, tracking, certificates, forums
-   Integration plugin: enrollment, refunds, error handling

## Technical Communication

-   OAuth2 client credentials flow
-   REST API calls WordPress → OpenEdX
-   JWT tokens
-   Webhook-style triggers on order completion

## Production Considerations

-   Set up Stripe/PayPal gateways
-   Configure SSL
-   Enable email notifications
-   Backups and monitoring
-   Load balancing for high traffic

## Common Issues

-   **JWT Token Fails:** check domain, client ID/secret, staff user
-   **Enrollments Not Working:** confirm Course ID, mode, and email
    match
-   **Access Issues:** verify user email and course availability
