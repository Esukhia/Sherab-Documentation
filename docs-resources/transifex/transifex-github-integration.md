# 🔗 Transifex GitHub Integration Guide

This guide outlines the steps for integrating a GitHub repository with Transifex to automate localization updates for Open edX projects.

---

## 📁 1. Create a Project in Transifex

To begin, create a new project in Transifex:

1. Go to your Transifex dashboard.
2. Click **"Create Project"** and fill in the following fields:

   - **Name your project**: Enter a meaningful project name.
   - **URL to open-source license**: Provide the URL to your open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
   - **Choose project type**: Select **File-based**.
   - **Target languages**: Choose the languages you want to translate.

     > ✅ **Currently used languages**: `bo`, `cs`, `es_419`, `fr`, `id`, `vi`, `zh_CN`

## 🌿 2. Create a New Branch on GitHub

To manage Transifex changes separately from your production code:

- Create a **dedicated branch** from your main branch (e.g., `sherab-dev` or `sherab-prod`).
- Use this branch specifically for Transifex pull requests and translation syncs.
- After review, merge the changes into the main branch as needed.

> 💡 This helps keep translation updates isolated and organized.
